# Playing with Python

These scripts are just playful implementations regarding games, scraping, image changes, etc.
All represent easy and fun scripts, representating a needed Python training.

## Scripts

Each script in this repo is roughly explained here.

### 1_TicTacToe

Simple script of the famous game "Tic Tac Toe". It is a command line application.
In this project, user input is used.
Actions are separated by functions in order to have cleaner code.

Libraries imported:
    a) random

### 2_Blackjack

Script of the game "Blackjack". It is a command line application.
In this project, user input is used.
Actions are separated by functions in order to have cleaner code.

    a) pillow


### Important points to be considered:

    1 - Some of these were based and are my implementations of the Udemy's course "2020 Complete Python Bootcamp: From Zero to Hero in Python"
        course url: https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/ 
        Still, the scripts on this repository are of my development and not equal to the great solutions provided in the course.
    
    2 - The Jupyter Notebook was used in the implementation and the scripts were developed in that tool. Other tools might require additional libraries to be          downloaded.
